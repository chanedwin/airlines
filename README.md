# Accessing the notebooks/results

* For best user experience, download the .html file by opening the [html file](https://github.com/chanedwin/airlines/blob/main/notebooks/Improving_support_team_workload_experiment.html) in github, hit the download button, then when the page opens right click and hit *save as* then save it as a .html file, then open in locally. This is because the pandas-profiling widget isn't rendered properly on github.
* Otherwise, you can view the [.ipynb](https://github.com/chanedwin/airlines/blob/main/notebooks/Improving_support_team_workload_experiment.ipynb) file, but you won't get to see the pandas-profiling report unfortunately.
